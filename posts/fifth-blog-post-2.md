# My final 18 Icons

Okay first set and my main icons for my website are:

- Hands
- Clipboard
- Book
- Mind
- House
- Raindrop
- Money
- Meditate 
- Fruit

Coming up with their respective pair wasn't difficult at all, i kind of just thought **what is the purpose of the icon/message, what does it mean and what is the answer?** and added the statment of the first icon to find the pair, if that makes sense. I was imagining the text with the icon on my website explaining them. 

Second set of icons:

- Iphone
- Tick
- Searching 
- Heart
- Pin/location
- Plant
- Coin
- Flower
- Shield

Adding titles/statments helped solidify my choices for the pairs and made the pairing make sense. When visualising my website i thought how can i sell my wellness retreat to people and make it appealing. 

So my final 18 looked something like this:

**It's effective, find community and stay in touch with new friends.** 
*hands - phone*

**We offer mental health support.** 
*mind - heart* 

**Explore wellness and mental health topics, guides and practises.** 
*book - magnifying glass* 

**It's professional with fully licensed psychologists.** 
*clipboard - tick* 

**We offer affordable rates and fees.** 
*piggybank - coin* 

**Relaxing and rejuvinating atmospheres in green/blue spaces.** 
*meditate - flower* 

**Find a centre near you.** 
*house - pin* 

**Create healthy, long lasting habbits.**
*apple - shield* 

**Effective detoxification and growth.** 
*raindrop - plant*
