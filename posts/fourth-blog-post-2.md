# Creating my icons 

These are some quick steches i did in class for the icons that came to mind right away. I always knew i wanted them to be inside circles but i stopped sketching the circles cause it was getting messy lol.

Later on you will see how i moved these around and created their pairing icon. I ened up going back and put a **pink heart** on the ones that i ended up using.
