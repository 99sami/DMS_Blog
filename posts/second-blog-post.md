# Key moments 

A key moment I've identified in my sequence is centred around our training, what goes on behind the scenes and the live performances. Me and my house debuted this year and we are still in the early stages of our journey so a lot of work and time is being poured into practising building ourselves up. I foreshadow this part by opening with us practasing but then going into my life outside ballroom. Later when the video switches it connects back to the first scene. 

​My plan: 

1. Use a match cut technique to connect rehearsals to main stage  

2. Crossfade the smooth jazz (represents sami) to high energy beats (represents persia)

3. Using a J-cut technique, I want to go from our videos training the choreography with the audio of the crowd cheering/screaming and then cut to the live show that is matching that audio. ​I think this will enhance the story and show part of the process of my life and the world I'm building.
