#  THEMES

For my self portrait video I am to portray the themes of duality and growth. 
When I think about myself there are two versions that exist in me;

**There is Sami,** who is very relaxed, introverted and quiet. If not at work or uni his day mainly looks like going on walks, shopping, or being at a cafe enjoying his own company or occasionally catching up with a friend. Mornings/early afternoons are his favourite time of the day. 

**Then there is Persia,** who is my personality when I'm on stage performing or when I have to step up. 
I am involved in the Ballroom queer scene here in Naarm and a part of the House of DIESEL who are my chosen family. We do a lot of work for the scene here holding balls, vogue nights, performances, workshops, community sessions etc. This side of me is very outgoing, usually for nightlife and when I'm performing I completely tap into her essence. 

When Iâ€™m not doing community work or performing Iâ€™m a very reserved and peaceful person. I will usually spend my time outside by nature alone, I love my alone time, and just be walking around or listening to music. I wanted to start with that side of me, and end with the other side of my life which is on the opposite end of the spectrum. 

I find the difference between sami and persia quite interesting so i wanted to theme my video around the different sides while also showing my life, family and friends.
