# The emotional tone of the video

In my video I've used a mix of match cuts, and  L/J cuts and crossfades for the audio to connect moments like the rehearsals to stage performances. I wanted to capture the emotional tone of dream big because everything starts with an idea (like the videos of us training and experimenting choreography to perform it at Fed Square). You can make your goals and dreams happen. 

I want to portray feelings of excitement, stardom, performance, high energy 

I also wanted to highlight my chosen family/community as they play a huge role in my purpose and I wouldn’t be here without them. ​

I want the tone to be wholesome, inspiring and real/authentic - showing all sides to the experience.

## The relation / connection 

I want people to see the connection between having two different modes of being. As humans were complex being by nature and i find that to be a beautiful quiality to people and life. I hoped to connect the two worls that live inside me and evoke the same feeling in others watching the video. 


### The rhythm / pace 

I want the pace of the video to start soft but give viewers a tease of the pace of t video by opening with a small reharaal snippet. As the video goes on, about half way through we enter the high energy segment. It can almost be understood as going from **daytime** to **nighttime** - from **light** to **dark**
