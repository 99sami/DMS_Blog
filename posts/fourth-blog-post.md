Today we learnt about design thinking theory and tools to create designs for users and clients. 

# Black Square Activity 

Using only 4 black squares per thumbnail box, we were challenged to produce a range of compositions that express the word below. I found this quite challanging usuing the shape of a suqare and it really forces you to try new arrangments and keep on digging deeper. You really only have so much to work with so coming up with so many versions was super intresting way to push creativity and language.

**these were our tools (the squares) and what we had to work with**

## Assignment 2 Brainstomring 

This assignment we need to create a suite of 9 responsive graphic icons that have a relating image/icon surrounding a concept for webpage design; 18 icons in total. 

The options for concepts were: 
- Growth
- Home
- Movement
- Climate
- Community
- Future
- Empty
- Legacy
- Calm
- Memory
- System
- Dream

Initially when thinking about the assignment i was tossing up between **growth**, **calm** and **community**. 
I wanted my website to be mental health focused as this can relate to all three concepts, and upon brainstomring i had the idea to base my website and concpet off a *mental health retreat / get away program that allows people to go out into nature for a few weeks, connect with people, eat healthy and exercise, engage in community sessions, therapy etc etc*.

I decided to choose  *growth*.
