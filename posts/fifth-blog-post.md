# The pen tool 

In class today we did an excercise to familiarise ourselves with the pen tool, the tool we will use to make our icons. To be honest i found this excercise really hard but such good practise because ive used illustrator heaps and i would say im quite goo don it, but with the pen tool im usually winging it and just fixing up the errors while hoping for the best.
