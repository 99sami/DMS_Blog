# The pen tool 

In class today we did an excercise to familiarise ourselves with the pen tool, the tool we will use to make our icons. To be honest i found this excercise really hard but such good practise because ive used illustrator heaps and i would say im quite goo don it, but with the pen tool im usually winging it and just fixing up the errors while hoping for the best.

This exercise taught me a lot on how to control the pen tool and i used the techniques a lot in my final work. 

The piggy bank was the hardest one to perfect and i faced some road blocks with a few of my icons and the pen tool. I solved this by doing the pen tool game and really disecting the anchor points and would go inbetween the game and my work each anchor point to slowly correct the image.

As you can see here i was really struggling with getting the shield and piggybank to work out. The piggybank especially. I ended up working kind of backwards but start with the body not the head to get the correct shape as ovals were a lot smoother to produce.

After so many attempts i finally got it just how i wanted it.

See how many anchor points there ended up being, being a lot more intentional with each one allowed me to sustain the shape and stop it from glitching out.
