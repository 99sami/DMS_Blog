# Adding sound. 

This week we went around campus recording any interesting sounds we can find and add to our HTML icons. The idea is to add an accompanying sound so when the image swaps theres an audio-visual response happening.

Using a device provided by school i went in my group to record what we could find. A lot of our sounds came from metal objects like the outdoor tables, fences, poles and bike racks. We used different materials to produce sounds from these metals like our hands, sticks, rocks etc. I recorded 4 sounds and used all in my final project after tweaking it a bit in Audition. I learnt how to adjust the timing and add affects like fades.

I gathered the rest of my audio from things around my house such as phones, doorbells, and even recorded sounds from my video games and used these in my work. Like before, all my sounds went through some heavy tweaking in Audition to get the desired pitch and effect. I was freestyling a lot of it, just tweaking different settings here and there until i was happy but overall i think they turned out quite good and clear.
